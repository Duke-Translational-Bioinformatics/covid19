# covid19
A home repo for coordinating data science research activities at Duke around SARS-CoV-2/COVID19.

For now, it's a public repo, but if there are things that should be private we can flip it to private, so use the repo as if it will go public at some point.

## Current Efforts

- **Launching phone survey with Clarity Consulting Group:** We're about to launch a survey primarily focused on objective measures of social distancing in North Carolina. Contact: @nickeubank
- **Looking for location-tracking firm willing to share:** Location tracking firms likely have the very best data for measuring social distancing acccurately and at scale. See Issue #4 . Contact: @nickeubank
- **Writing NSF Grant for phone surveys to allow for greater frequency / sample sizes:** Currently I think AC is focused on this?

## Other Resources

We're also trying to use this site as a clearing house for good data we find elsewhere, and to alert people to the efforts of others to avoid duplication of effort. See `third_party_data.md` for a list of currently available public data.
